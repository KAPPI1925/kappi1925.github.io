      doi: "10.1007/s12145-024-01586-y",
      abstract: "Accurate and quantitative assessment of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes is crucial for understanding the spatial dynamics and environmental impacts within specific regions. In hilly terrains like the Nilgiris district in Tamil Nadu, India, these assessments are particularly challenging due to the complex topography and sparse ground truth labels. This study employs data mining techniques with multisource data integration to address these challenges."
