        description: "YOLO represents the one-stage object detection also called regression-based object detection. Object in the given input is directly classified and located instead of using the candidate region. The accuracy from two-stage detection is higher than one-stage detection where one-stage object detection speed is higher than two-stage object detection. YOLO has become popular because of its Detection accuracy, good generalization, open-source, and speed.",

        description: "Accurate and quantitative assessment of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes is crucial for understanding the spatial dynamics and environmental impacts within specific regions. In hilly terrains like the Nilgiris district in Tamil Nadu, India, these assessments are particularly challenging due to the complex topography and when classified using sparse ground truth labels.",
